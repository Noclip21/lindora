var crap = "So today at a local store I when I went to check out I was rung up by a near perfect white(looked to be a pure germanic) girl with what looked like swastika on her right arm. I lost my spaghetti so fucking hard, the first time I have ever lost it. I didn't know if it was appropriate to comment on it(in a positive way) and her coworker was also in the vicinity so I didn't. I feel bad now for not supporting her but maybe it would have caused her trouble. It makes me happy to know not all white females are brainwashed by multikulti. I wouldn't get a swastika as I don't think it's a good idea from a strategic standpoint and the nazis don't represent me but her actions have inspired me to seriously consider getting a celtic cross on my back. But only the men that they want to have sex with them, mind you. They are under no obligations to do the reverse. In fact, they want ~80% of men to never have any chance ever while the other 20% are forced to have sex even with the ones they don't want. Literal breeding studs. Even it it was data from a satellite based scintillation counter, the brightness of colors in an a heat map is always a user-selected scale, and the map itself interpolated data. You could plot a map like this with less than 200 data points if you wanted. Feminazis in the tech press have been hurling criticism at him all week. It is time to show George that the feminazis are NOT the majority, and that most westerners still oppose censorship. D2 Necromancer was more like a buddhist druid than a real necromancer. He raised skeletons as a tool to fight evil, he didn't speak with the spirits of the deceased to accomplish a goal. He was more like a fancy puppeteer who happened to use bones as his puppets. How can one argue for a morality without God? Without an objective source of morality all moral codes become subjective; so how would it be possible to argue for or against a particular moral stance with, say, psychopaths or other people who acknowledge the subjectivity of morality but have a different moral preference? How is a state supposed to decide on laws that boil down to morality? I'm not so sure some kind of bacterial action isn't involved in what you call changes, the smell of months-old piss becomes really horrendous is what I've noticed when dumping these things in the toilet Someone mentioned that he didn't like DokiDoki much, then the thread ended. So let's hear the pros and cons to DokiDoki, particularly in the context of the past seasons. Well, he's in a human body, so eventually he'll have a wet dream and figure it out. Those aren't even remotely similar, though. A missionary or sales associate goes around knowing that their target audience is pretty likely to blow them off. 8man consistently gets rejected as a basic human being, not as someone trying to peddle shit. Check the Guide if you're new to buyfagging, or just want to know some basic info. It covers nearly everything, including websites, shipping information, and a glossary so you can brush up on your buyfag vocab. Is this worth it? I just finished reading Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean. I somewhat disliked its ending and the fact that Steel Ball Run and Jojolion are set in an alternate universe is a whole turnoff. I would had liked to see a canon continuation of Stone Ocean instead. Try to avoid making single-image requests. Making a single image thread deletes a previous thread from the last page. Please include 4 to 5 similar images in your thread to get it going. Use resources like danbooru, gelbooru or even Google Image Search. Check the catalog to avoid making a duplicate thread. This way, we can share and contribute more images more effectively and efficiently. If bumping a thread, please include a picture instead of just writing 'bump' and please do not necrobump threads that have reached their image limit.

I'm wrapping up 39 before passing it off to be released. Unless the head-dude is busy today, we should have a release sometime today. Also a while ago Miho's VA confirmed on her Twitter that she recorded some lines for the CD, so it's likely that other classmates not listed on the site will appear too. Not enough!! No sir! Why on Earth would we ever stop at such an odd number? Why stop at all!? Indeed, the Mugi train keeps on chugging in another delightful installment of threads, dedicated to everyone's favorite keyboardist, Kotobuki Tsumugi! New to these? Welcome aboard! Stay awhile, have some tea and cake, and prepare your heart for more HNNNGHs than you can handle! What the heck is this? Some kind of special Mugi program for my computer? If so, I want it, perhaps a fellow Mugibro knows? And second, does anyone have the OP image? You think I'd've seen every Mugi picture there is, but I guess not. Hopefully someone has it buried in their hard drive. Much obliged. ok. so i can't figure out how to explain this without telling the entire relationship story, so you guys are going to get the entire mess. And at the verry least, i'm providing porn, so deal with it. which is probably for the better because other than her and i, i haven't really told anyone the whole thing and it's probably better to talk this through from square 1... heh... communication. suppose i'm one hell of a hypocrite looking back on it. oh yes. liquid courage is being consumed here (goldschlager+green apple pucker+hawiian punch), so fuck the grammar nazi's alright setting: college. i was put on academic probation about a year and a half into my first time at college. my grandmother who was had been living with my family since i was 7 landed in the nursing home. Parents called every weekend, college got hard, i got depressed. Ran to videogames. 18 year old guys should NOT be thinking that college doesn't matter because you're just going to end up a cripple creaming incoherenttly at the top of your lungs becausee you need help to take a shit anyways... but i digress so ac-pro.. went to community college, it was pretty much easy mode after being in 3 different enginnering programs in under 20 months. Got an associates for cad drafting... and then i found out that my first college would take me back. I was over the moon when i found that out. Graduating became a bit of a mission at that point, i fucked up round 1. round 2? that was going to be different. I picked a business degree because that was basicaly the fastes track out of there, and i had talked to a number of family friends who told me i have a natural gift for sales. I was thinking that i was going to big dollar B2B sales. That sort of thing... well Lheaman brothers imploding for 2 dollars a share fucked that plan.... but that's years in the future. So i'm sitting in the lobby of the campus theatre. Nice place, it's where all the new freshmen are coming in. A little about myself. 6'4, good looking 1/4 italian 1/4 german /14 polish 1/4 i can't remember. Black hair blue eyes. About 180. 3/4 of a lifetime on SSRI's will do that. Appitite supressants the lot of them. I waterski. Been involved in the martial arts since i was 7. so i look attractive... or so i've been told. I personaly think i'm nothing special. Anyway. I was there for 1 reason. I was going to get a girlfriend. Now keep in mind up untill this point, i had never even really TALKED to a woman in a romanti setting before. But i figured, uppercalssman, college, the fact i could legally buy alchohol in the US, i could get a girl... and get laid. So that's when i ran into HER probably about 5'4 DD breasts, hourglass shape, glasses, and dragon t shirt, dragon earings. Mother. fucking. Jackpot. she had lost her wallet, and wanted help looking. I'm a good soul, or so i like to fool myself into believing. Been in the boyscouts long enough to actually buy into the do a good turn thing. (and it's where i got my love affair with rope from... not bondage, but knots. I love making shit with my hands) anyway, i decided to help her look... fruitless search. It was actually in her parents hotell room, but we crossed campus 2-3 times and looked for hours. I'm no fool, i knew i had an in, but i decided to play it cool. Don't look desperate decided to wait a week before i talked to her again. And i did just that... we lived in the same dorm, a week passed, went down, to say hi. Guess what. TAKEN. Fuck. Should have known better at a hard science college with a 4:1 boy:girl ratio. Nstill not sure if fate was kind or cruel. She was dating the guy across the hall. (and for those keeping score? We are are now on pint glass 2 of drank) so a year passes guy across the hall and her break up about 4-5 weeks before christmas break. Me being the charitable soul i am, i decide to be there for her. Sit with her at lunch. Maybe i'll get another shot, maybe i won't. A 4:1 ratio ain't kind to the guys, but girls had a saying, the odds are good but the goods are odd. So i hadn't succeded in my quest in finding a girl... though i did have friends and i left my room for reasons other than classes, so i was considering this a rousing success anyway. Anyway it's the last day before christmas break. 95% of everyone else in the dorm is gone. Her parents are coming to pick her up, and i offered to stay till they got there. Me being the socially oblivious soul that i was, i tried to say goodbye at this point. Still being friends to her, and the guy across the hall... then she kissed me. Shocked? Yes. Stunned? Certianly. Akward? Worst kiss ever. Wheels spun. I'm not an idiot. I know what this means. That first kiss sucked. This time i lead, and i'm prepared. A full dip and a kiss. Casanova would have been proud. We part ways, and the next week was the longest of my life. Now. I lived 6 hours south of college, she 8 and conviently almost due south of me. i saw her over break, and we were in love like you would expect 2 college students to be. But... she was a catholic school girl...by choice even. Went to a catholic highschool. Now i'm nominaly roman catholic, but i would say i play fast and loose with the rules. Jesus lead by example. Be a good person, don't get stuck in the details. She had the details punded into her head. So we go to 1st base, second, then third, but we stop. No sex untill marrage. That was the rule... the line. I figured she might crack eventually, but i would play along... eventually...some day (pnt glass 2 gone. Goldschlagers gone...dammnit. On to kaluah and rootbeer). Long long time ago. The writer who came up with the milk cow on the farm and the fucking stupid cults was given way too much control over both of them. People hated him cause he refused to provide more content for the subjects and he refused to provide content because people hated him and his writing. And so to fix the issue, Fen to just pretty much remade the ideas and added them, without removing the old shit. That was enough for me. Yeah, I once had a gun, and I'm a pretty nice guy who generally loves freedoms and such...BUT When I held this gun in my hand, it's like this overwhelming feeling of awesome power awesomely overwhelmed me with its power, and I saw this freedoms-having guy having his freedoms and I couldn't stop myself. I SHOT HIS FREEDOMS RIGHT IN THE FUCKING LIBERTIES. Afterwards, I was so ashamed and appalled that I threw the damn gun at the enslaved husk of a man, sweeping over the bleeding corpse of his de-libertied, dead freedoms. He picked up the gun, and... Engineering grad student here, if you're like me and your lab/office is in some remote corner of the building without windows, and there's no shooting going on, just lock up, try not to scare the SWAT team, and take it easy. BUT if you have to hold your own, an engineering lab can be a veritable arsenal of makeshift weaponry. A good number of labs often have useful that also happens to be ridiculously dangerous. Most labs will have a big o' tank of liquid nitrogen, you can make simple pressure bombs or more complex liquid nitrogen cannons with that. Just be careful not asphyxiate. High power lasers are surpisingly common and can be used to blind the fuck out of things. If you've got a pneumatic hook up and some valving, it shouldn't be too hard to manage a pneumatic cannon. Don't even get me started on the things you could do if you have robots around. But don't, unless your life depends on it, You know what killed the flechette for infantry use? The sabots. The sabots would eject at a lower velocity out of the barrel than the flechette itself, but it still travels fast enough to harm the user (or anyone immediately around the user) should they ricochet off a rock or even a misshapen mound of dirt in front of the barrel. Solve the sabot-ejection issue, and then the flechette is back on the table. I came across the grips randomly on ebay when I was looking for something cheap to put on the gun Once I saw the grips, I knew what I had to do.. The Kiss Kiss, Boom Boom is what Marshal Law had engraved on his uzi in Marshal Law takes Manhattan.... I was on a cheuvanistic kick as a result of a girl complaining that I had named the blanket I keep in the trunk of my car the Skank blanket... so.... I figured I'd just whip it out and run with it flapping in the wind (metaphorically) We managed to lose a match and still call it a wain because all we lost were trash filler tanks and we locked 6 T-57s. Also we gave that land up on purpose. If you already have land, you can't do a landing. And the whole bongistan situation is time sensitive on the order of two days to exploit. She was uncovered by a guy who was digging a new foundation for his house in Vermont, I wish I could get more info but the guy who found her is dead as she has been hanging on the wall of a gunshop as a curiosity for a very, very long time. This is going to really push the limits of what can be restored. Oh and subscribe to my channel, it helps keep me motivated and working on projects WILLIS! I SUMMON THEE FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE COSMOLINE! ARISE AND DRAW FOR ME THUS! Kawaii japanese little girl gets slapped in head by flying dildo, onlooker distressed and flushed facially, he cries out,YOU SONNOFABITCH! Then he grab SKS and go innawoods. In woods he squats like timmy congo the vietcongo boogaloo from SKS wikipida. But then he see random homeless man in wood, eyes widen to drum mags and angry onlooker with SKS say, BRRRT and zergface, den da hobos cry out, oh noez, mai hobo goldz, den he run awayz. But onlooker man say, fool cannot escap hobo seeking Simonovka Karbine slipper propeller! and den the cleaning kit ejects from stock and activates the cosmoline powered gyro jet propulsion system! Den da hobo is bayonet and bacon was good. Same could be said of voting. That make sure they know how to use it bullshit annoys me. I'd rather EVERYONE buy guns they don't know how to use and let nature weed out the stupid, than let any group impose any kind of prerequisite that you just KNOW will be changed and abused if not now then sometime in the future by those who feel so inclined. Other than that it's fine. I believe night on the sun was before M&A, but I get your gist. I think the issue is that people can't grapple with their stuff on a song-by-song basis. Even building nothing's fairly spotty at times, and good news and WWD are great in spots, as are their outtakes. Case in point: King Rat, Whale Song (among MM's best songs, he still plays King Rat all the time) there's the word Anyway the great thing about Interstate 8, especially if you take it in original EP form (without the live tracks), is that there's literally not a single bad or even average song on it. Interstate 8, All Night Diner, Sleepwalkin', Tundra/Desert, and Edit the Sad Parts is probably one of the most consistently great group of songs ever released, even though it's short. The live part is a bunch of great songs but again it's compiled so it should be I think you're comparing apples and oranges with the words and emotions vs noise point. As far as notes and rhythms go, a large portion of the population finds coherent melodies and rhythms pleasing, for whatever reason (I'm not about to drag us into a conversation about the philosophy of the mind/ evolutionary theory, because I have a feeling we'd all just be talking out our asses). But the dissonance and randomness of free jazz isn't so widely appreciated, for whatever reason. That's basically what I'm getting at. I would like to drag you into the philosophy ad suggest that the determination of pleasurable music is purely the result of exposure. If you grew up with Ayler in movies and commercials and then heard some present day top 40 pop you would probably think its the most annoying thing ever. That's how listening to an album until you enjoy it works. I'm a vocalist in a metal band and I'm searching for a microphone. I need some help finding the mic perfect for my needs. Its very fucking loud(obviously) so I need something that won't pick up all the environmental noise. At the moment I have an AT2010(condenser) that I bought two years ago, but I feel the need to replace it. 90% of the time your media is fairly priced and available through legal channels. But still you insist on getting media for free because you can't bring yourself to pay less than the price of a cup of coffee. I pay for muh gaems more nowadays because I usually want to be able to play them online, with friends. I make a point of waiting for sales to do so though. I pirate my music because I don't really care much about music. I wouldn't care if all of a sudden there were a lot less bands and artists making it, because I don't consume much of it, and it's only mental wallpaper when I do. I rarely pirate TV and movies, but that's because I watch so little TV and so few movies. It isn't worth my time to watch, let alone the time to pirate or the money to buy. I pirate a lot of pornography. I'm up to about half a terabyte, so even if porn production and/or porn piracy was stopped tomorrow, I think I'd have enough to last for a while. Some of it is weird Japanese stuff that'd be hard to buy legit here, some of it is just well, I can get it for free, so I will. Are you fucking retarded? SLI 480s beats the shit out of the 7870, SLI 480s beats the shit out of a 680, the closest thing to SLI 480s in 1 gpu is a slightly underclocked titan. and it cost 200 dollars for SLI that means both gpus Just want to let you all know that the pictre on this thread sent me off to a private corner of the internet about 2 hours ago, and now i think it's about to do that again. circling the drain of sleep, wishing more people posted here at night. what's the deal with that anyway? i thought writers were insomniacs. oh, as to op: ''liberals don't read anything, not in any sense worthy of the word. anyone who can read properly does not do so as a political affiliation. pic for what i write with in my notebook. no smudging, good ink distribution, good line width, takes a while to die, fits well in the hand, cheap. thinking about switching to the bic atlantis because they are also very good and i am partial to pens that retract, but they only come 2 to a pack which is disappointing. since i am on my last round stic (the box has lasted a long while), when it finally dies i will most likely switch to the soft feel retractable. pretty much bic is a win except for ultra-round stic. only bic product that disappoints me. Authors who ran smallholdings: Herman Melville, Robert Frost, Jack London, Emerson, based Horace, and others. PROS: Winter / nights to read and write. No need to fall back on teaching; avoid weekly exposure to the works of try-hard, no-talent creative writing students. Interact with nature. Learn a panoply of skills (simple mechanics, water management, etc.). Get fit growing your own food. Females find dual class writer-farmers romantic. Achieve reputation among local rubes as a bookish eccentric. CONS: Hard to earn an exceptional living. Long days in the dregs of summer. Crop failures might lead to suicide viz a rafter-slung noose. All in all, the pros favor the cons. Time to plow. I know a lot of outdoor people (read hippies) I will no doubt have plenty of help. I know 5-10 people who have the same goals as me who are serious enough to make it. I'm hoping we end up buying in the same area and will have a fairly mutually supportive network. Ive also got the retailing connections to sell produce. I will be having a few mini festivals every year too. 30 dollars a head for a weekend festival that will not cost me more than 10 a head. I will probably have to limit it around two hundred tickets to keep it under control. If I do that twice a year I will have an almost base 10k income, before I even sell one head of lettuce. I have many other ideas and ways to make money as well. You can't change the world alone, but you can take small steps to improve your life, thus improving the ones around you, and create your own chaos theory. Start by growing your own coriander. Finish by ending world hunger. I agree. My brother pretty much pulled an OP, but it didn't stop after the first time. He started doing it when I was 7, and continued to do it for 4 years until my parents finally put a lock on my door. I've decided to never tell my boyfriend because he might not be able to look at me the same way. What he doesn't know won't hurt him. I saw one of my friends (who I had a huge crush on) in the restroom using the urinal. He talked to me for a bit and then left. Since he didn't flush, I tasted his piss. I'm still ashamed of it. But I was really horny at the time. Chastity = absolute value of (height in inches divided by age in years, minus your zodiac factor). The zodiac factor is what sign you are - earlier the sign, higher the number. Put a strand of hair into colored liquid. The number the equation gives you is how many drops of water you put into the colored liquid. The depth at which the hair begins to float determines your level of chastity, with four levels: at the very bottom is pure maiden waifu/bachelor husbando, lower middle is indulging impure thoughts, upper middle is a one-off adulterous fling, and very top is an ongoing affair. I like it. The combat is slower but still very involved. You actually have time to think about what you're doing and react to what's being said. 30fps, no styles, no lock on are retarded arguments made by casuals. If the game is so easy with the removal of the aforementioned aspects of the previous DMC games, why aren't the people who complain about DmC making the best DmC combo videos? These missions are spread throughout the game and don't repeat in a single playthrough. Furthermore, each mission will have optional objectives, which will ultimately affect how your MC brothers treat and view you, as well as your family. For example, if you play as Jax in a given playthrough, you have the option to complete a mission by the book and be home in time to tuck in Abel, thereby helping your reputation with Tara, or forsaking your paternal duties to serve the MC at the expense of your family. This will also weigh heavily on how the game ends. well... it has a higher top speed, better munitions or ability to be fitted with, and can fly through a cloud without losing its only advantage. Fit the f14 with the f15 intake and it too will be able to fly at mach 2.5+, or better yet, design a new one and get even better performance. Which brings me to the other really cool thing about this game. In basically every game I've ever played you rack up a huge garage of cars in a tremendous fucking hurry, but in this one you pretty much just pick one to save for early on and then all you can really do is keep it while doing hektik mawdz. Really immersive, I think, and I'd kind of like to see a remake, maybe with international cities and moving between them would cost some kind of money? Seems like doing 150mph through Brooklyn would make a pretty sweet game. This is a type of movie genre that sort of got really big in the 50s, peaked out in the 70s, and kind of stopped being popular in the 80s, only to become gay in the 2000s. I'm pretty big into huge sets, and/or great practical effects (I love the fantasy movies of the 80s). Something to really sweep you up, you know? Harryhausen, as I've posted, is always good. Even lame cheesy shit is ok, because I love a good laugh. I've been contemplating picking up a used set of I, Claudius. So, does anyone have some input? Great, we can now do the most dangerous shoots imaginable and not have to worry about killing any stunt people. Just have robots do it all and insure them heavily so when things go disastrously wrong all you lose is an expensive piece of equipment and not someone's arm or even their life. He bought a one way ticket to Washington, DC, and after arriving there went to Knoxville. He arrived at a gas station and told the attendant that his car couldn't start. The attendant told him that they weren't the keys so he was stranded in Knoxville. He then hitchhiked to a hotel and made a lasting impression on the manager. He went in and out of the lobby a total of five times before renting a room but he then went out of the hotel and was never seen alive again. Twelve hours later Blair's body, naked from the waist down, was found in the parking lot. His odyssey had came to a violent end and although authorities believe that the danger he though he was in was imaginary, but he still ended up murdered. To this day Blair's mysterious case remains unsolved but his family hopes that one day somebody will tell them why he died."
